# v1 Example Scripts

These are one-off scripts from AgentCom v1 Day 1 (Feb 9, 2026). They contain hardcoded agent names and tokens from the initial Mind network setup.

**Do not use these directly.** They're preserved as historical artifacts.

For generic, reusable scripts, see the parent `scripts/` directory:
- `connect.js` — WebSocket client (env-configured)
- `send.js` — Send messages via HTTP API
- `poll.js` — Poll agent mailbox
