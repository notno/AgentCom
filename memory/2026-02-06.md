# 2026-02-06 Session Notes

## Context Overflow Incident

**What happened:** Yesterday's MMF image cataloging (~207 Txarli images) overflowed context. Nathan couldn't reach me for hours until removing images and doing /reset.

**Lesson:** Bulk image/media work must:
1. Process → save to disk immediately (don't accumulate in context)
2. Use sub-agents that summarize results as text, not attachments
3. Never bring large batches of images back into main context

This is now a hard rule. No repeats.
