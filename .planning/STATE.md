## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phases 1 (Sidecar) and 2 (Task Queue) are parallel -- no dependencies between them
- [Roadmap]: Phase 5 (Smoke Test) is the quality gate -- nothing after it matters if trivial tasks fail
- [Roadmap]: Phases 6, 7, 8 are independent after smoke test passes -- can parallelize
- [Roadmap]: PR gatekeeper deferred to v2 -- needs 50+ tasks of production data to calibrate heuristics

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Elixir version bump (1.14 to 1.17+) should be considered before starting v2 work for :gen_statem logger fix
- [Research]: Sidecar queue.json atomicity -- fs.writeFileSync has partial-write-on-crash risk, acceptable for launch
