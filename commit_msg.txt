Fix task routing, queue summary, and add agent targeting dropdown

Hub changes:
- Complexity classifier: short descriptions without trivial keywords
  now classify as standard (not trivial). Prevents natural language
  tasks from being routed to shell execution.
- TaskQueue.stats: by_priority now only counts queued tasks, fixing
  dashboard queue summary showing completed tasks in urgent count.
- Endpoint: pass assign_to param through to task queue.
- TaskQueue: store assign_to on task struct for operator targeting.
- Scheduler: respect assign_to field — if set, target that specific
  agent regardless of routing tier.
- Dashboard: add agent targeting dropdown next to task input,
  populated live from connected agents with state indicators.

Sidecar changes:
- ShellExecutor: no longer falls back to task.description as a shell
  command. Only executes explicit metadata.shell_command.
- Dispatcher: sidecar tasks without shell_command fail gracefully
  with clear error instead of running description as bash.

Backlog:
- Added token roles / auth separation item to inbox.
